# Wikipedia Chatbot with LSTM: Exploring Transformer Motivations

This hobby project involves building a Wikipedia chatbot using an **LSTM network** to analyze its **shortcomings** in language understanding and response generation. By testing the chatbot on real-world queries, I aim to identify the **limitations of LSTMs**â€”such as difficulty in handling long-range dependencies and inefficient training. 

The ultimate goal is to use these insights to understand **why the Transformer architecture was developed** and how it overcomes these issues. This hands-on approach allows for a deeper comparison of **sequential models** versus **attention-based architectures**.
